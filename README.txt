 	Hi There!

	This project is a clone of the popular game 'Pong' ,originally created by Alan Alcorn and
	released in 1972.
	The game is written entirely in c++ using the popular Simple DirectMedia Layer2(SDL2) library.
	No game engines were used in the making of this game.
	The motivation for this game was to explore game development from scratch.
	
	DISCLAIMER: The game is not perfect! There are glitches and bugs. Feel free to explore the source
	and possibly try to fix some bugs.


										      !IMPORTANT!
